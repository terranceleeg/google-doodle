## Brainstorm Ideas
1. National Hermit Day
2. National Lazy Day - Probably choosing this one.
## The Holiday Explained
I would take the time to explain the holiday to you, but that would defeat the purpose. -haha
## Color Ideas
### The color should give a boring overtone while still remaining high in contrast!
* hex #99978E - A darker grey.
* hex #CCA826 - This is a khaki type color.
* hex #FFB349 - A dulled orange, a more bright color of khaki.
* hex #89F0FF - This is a bright blue, complementary to the brighter orange.
* hex #26CCB3 - This is a darker blue/green, to complement the darker khaki color.
